### What's this all about
You'll see a many repos here - maybe even too many (is that even possible?). Likely none will be "presentable".

If you came to my profile looking for that beautiful, pretty portfolio-worth side-project, I'm sorry to disapoint you. There are none of those here.

I like having **at least** some level of practice/knowledge before working with a new programming language, framework, or concept in a "real-life" Project. **That's what these repos are for.**
