# Hey, I have some questions for you

## Company & Teams

- Do you have a career ladder?
- Do you have performance reviews? 
  - If so, how frequently? How progress is tracked/evaluated inside the company (developer-wise)?
- When was the last time you had to go through a crunch?
- Are you (interviewers) part of the team?
  - If not, why is the interviewing process not being handled by the team members themselves? Is this a cross-company policy?
  - If so, how's the team structured? How many layers of indirection between leadership and the team are there?
- Are there other foreigners in the company? How is the distribution across the company?


## Job Offering

- Why me? How does my profile fits this offering?
- Will I be working abroad (i.e. from Brazil) or should I relocate to another location?
  - If relocating, which costs are covered by the company? Are there any relocation costs - not covered by the company - I should be aware of?
- What's the pay range? 
  - Other than base compensation: Are there any perks, benefits, equity, ...?
    - For private companies: is there any profit sharing (and if so, what's the median)?
- What would be my main responsibilities? 

## Projects

### Microservices
- Do projects follow some kind of template? How do you avoid an evergrowing list of programming languages, frameworks, concepts in general... (and if this is something you worry about).
- How much freedom teams get when developing their solutions/microservices?
- How many microservices per team?

## Methodologies

- Do you follow any of the following methodologies, practices: Agile, Lean, SCRUM, Kanban, ...?
- Please describe the interaction between Engineers and other ICs (e.g. POs, PMs, designers, data scientists, ...).
- Tell me something you don't like about your current process.

## Quality Control

- Tell me about your CI. What tools do you use?
- This will probably differ from team to team... Is there a common ground (e.g. central registry for all project artifacts).
  - If so, is there a team to support CI issues ("how much time do you think teams spend on the ops part of DevOps")?
- Could you describe your process for changes? From the client's requirement to production.
- How do you keep up to date with security vulnerabilities, licensing, ...?
- Do you have dedicated QAs? Do you test your own changes? How do you approach acceptance/functional testing?
- Do you have a process for handling technical debt?
- How is documentation organized across the company? Is there a central place to find the necessary information? How do you avoid old/stale/deprecated information/documentation.
- Do you have dedicated support and operations teams to handle issues first? 
  - Do you have an on-call policy? Please describe your on-call policy if so.


## Onboarding & Learning

- How do you organize your onboarding process?
- Which tasks do you find more useful for new developers to take during the onboarding phase and why?
- How's the culture for knowledge transfer and learning inside the company?
- What do you do to avoid knowledge silos?
